getting back into this yet again!!
First task should probably be to archive the portal system and reimplement a solid base system
Then portals could be explored on another branch, but other things can be focused on as well
Chunk and TileRenderingSystem, huh...

TileRenderingSystem
	drawLocal()
Chunk
	linkLocal()
	attachCorner()
	attach()
	floodGrab()
WorldManager
	LOS()
	
I think it's okay to have neighbors within chunks and such...
Having a floodfill algorithm ready to go could be handy
Also it isss kinda functional, and doesn't seem too slow as it is
So maybe i should just state the problems more clearly and fix them

Problem: can see one tile out from the edge into what should be the void when in a non-euclidean tunnel
Related data structures and functions: the ones listed above, i would assume
Another wording of the situation: 
-a tile is being rendered that should not
-a neighbor value that should be -1 is not, or at least something similar is happeing
-it only appears along orthogonal lines from the character
-sometimes affected by your distance from the wall
-when i turn on wrapping for linkLocal(), the problem can't be seen, because all tiles show up
-all the neighbors of that edge are -1...
-if you disallow chunks outside of the active chunk from drawing, it still occassionally shows up 
--because it is part of the chunk you are already in, because the positions are relative
--despite neither instance actually being linked to anything vertically

replace this system entirely with lines attached to chunks that serve the same purpose
rn it's like those likes are along every single edge just to connect everything

I need to add a debug mode where i can pause the current configuration of the game and move around the scene
with a cursor
