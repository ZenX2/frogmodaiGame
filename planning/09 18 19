The action system needs to be able to return to the player for further input!!
See: ADOM when you walk into someone and it gives you a yes/no choice for talking/hitting(?)

I think I fixed the issue of what's rendered not matching up exactly with where actors are by moving rendering
to happen at the beginning of each cycle right after TimeSystem runs (which doesn't actually )
