Geordan Jehovah's Miniscule Parliment Breathing Hot Fire Upon Bargain-Bin Ladle Folk
Dungeon poop
fart fart fart
need to make LOOK command
which means need to make a CURSOR MODE (that can be reused in the Editor)
need make vaults (with entrances mapped out)

how should the world be structured for now? I like the one-way portals out from the hub area kinda thing
I want to start making some villages in addition to dungeons
dungeons are just where monsters live, they aren't necessarily evil
write dat morality/ethic/value system!!!

Races:
The Humanoids
	Humans
	Elves
	Dwarfs
	Doublelings
The Animal Folks (as non-anthropomorphic as possible)
	FROGS
	Bears
	Cats
The Insect Folks
	Flies
	Mantises
	Beetles
	Slugs
The Reptile Folks
	Iguanas
	Turtles
The Alien Starfish Folks
	Lobsters
	Crabs
	SHRIMP
	Starfish
	SquidFolk

Vaults for stock room shapes
Prefabs for things in rooms
	Large, Medium, and Small Features? (or like 1x1, 2x2, 3x3 etc sized 'feature slots')
		Then vaults have base terrain, terrain modifiers (eg. walls in different places), features, and objects
	Random objects that can be picked up or examined
	
Todo: test container system
Would a table or a shelf use a container? Yes probably
	Need a two-pane GUI for moving items between two containers (eg. inventory <-> table)
	
Have areas like Shadowgate where you need to carry a torch or some such
I would rather have puzzley stuff like that/SS13 kinda things (hand/item holding mechanics) than RPG stat grids
I would also prefer that it has actions that are not associated so closely to item categories like potions or wands

How do I have events that work slightly differently for different creatures?
