Okay I want to regress the movement/vision system back to a basic one
And then re-add non-euclidean elements on a per-space basis
	eg. for each portal space, if it's in your line of sight, swap to drawing the other dimension???
	fuck oops
	or
	draw that world on top for each portal (prevents recursion though...)
		or recurse until the next portal is offscreen
The chunk-boundary and portal code should be the same
	So an extra property added onto tiles that otherwise don't have it.
	So I probably don't need to change the tile.neighbors property... just how it's used??
	So I probably don't want to redraw tiles from other chunks that have already been drawn...
		Add every drawn tile to a list, stop if you'd redraw
Where is the old FOV code? For within a chunk.
		
--Okay, so what are all the pertinent files/functions for this feature?--
CharacterMovingSystem
	When a character tries to move out of their current chunk
		WRONG!!!
	Change it to trigger when they move in any direction where neighbor[dir] != -1
	So that you create a portal by setting a dir...
	It should probably be single property and not an array for every tile, no multi portals
		WRONG!!! corners! hmm.
		Disallowing moving between chunks via corners at all is not ideal.
		Okay so the array is okay for now...
	Okay I actually see no issues with how it works for moving between chunks
		besides changing it to any tile with set neighbors working as a portal
TileRenderingSystem
	drawLocal()
Chunk
	linkLocal()
	attachCorner()
	attach()

Also, as for story, I can make it about frogs and shrimps and spirit war jesus and such
Maybe have a map system for exploring the cosmology???

Also for making maps/chunks, I could have a system of two bitmaps for color, and a text file for characters
