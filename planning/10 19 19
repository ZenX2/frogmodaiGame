When an entity has X components, subscribe to Y events
Entity has empty signifier component and the other components required for that interface

Band of roving bards that influence political/popular opinion in the regions they visit
It would be cool to explore within a city for its cityness as opposed to delving a dungeon
I want to generate a city or town where the NPCs go from place to place doing tasks that transform resources and trading messages with each other

Non-lethal fights (getting drunk and surly)

Complex interactables (eg. gun with many keys for many small-grained parts of operating it in that train robbery 7drl)

Before finding direct node path, find path in the chunk graph?
But what if there is another point within the same chunk that is inaccessible without passing through different chunks???
In that case just regular BFS would be better
