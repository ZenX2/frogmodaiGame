*******COMBAT******
Maybe lets not have the combat be violent, and instead have combat be small talk
FUCK this is tough because I want to make a game where you kill the shit out of everything
But also making a diplomatic game could be interesting
What if it's just cosmetic bc gameplay simplicity but it makes it funny without altering mechanics.
NAAAH LOOOL LETS KILL SHIT
Ridiculous over the top violence in day to day life, ultimate catharsis
