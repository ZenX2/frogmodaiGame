MASTER PLAN

THE GREAT BIG TODO-LIST: (as of 12/29/17)
[]Items
	[x]Basic existence
	[x]Pickup
	[x]Drop
	[]Consume
	[]Wear/Wield
	[]Put in container
	[]Use as container
[]Character stats/traits/skills
[]Map/Chunk features
	[]seeing neighbor chunks
	[]moving player between chunks
		[]NEED to unload all neighboring chunks from old chunk (except those shared with the new active chunk)
			[]NEED to be able to serialize all components
			Should it be necessary to save anything other than serialized components?
			Ideally all info that needs to persist should just be components
			FFMain.playerID and all that shit should be fresh each time
			Going to have to rewrite a few things to fit the Reference/Renderable/Resolver model
			[]Identify components/systems to update with RRR-model
			[x]Add @EntityId where necessary
		[]REALLY SHOULD to refresh all stored entity ID's and entities and shit!!
[]Map/dungeon generation
[]Combat
[]AI
	[]Pathfinding
		[]Djikstra Maps
		[]A*
		[]Custom
	[]Need/Goal-Driven
[]Extra Shit
	[]GloboCorp logo + animation as an action/event that can happen during the game
	[]Image-to-ASCII/(those ascii tiles that are for shading)
	[]Have a globe spinning super fast so it looks like an energy ball down in a reactor room or some such
	[](VISION SYSTEM)Enemies remain invisible until succesful spot check

What will the game be like when this list is done?
Start in a city, there are buildings and street around you
You can go into an office and encounter NPCs and enemies
You can raid break rooms and get schwag

****** DAY-TO-DAY LOG: ******
12/28/17: We must next add djistkstra maps or whatever
And basic AI

12/29/17: I want most of the UI to be handled as Text-GUI forms!!! It's FORMS and Faxmachines, after all.
How do I pause to open a menu?
OH the lock in the action system
No one will do any actions as long as that's locked but systems can still process!
