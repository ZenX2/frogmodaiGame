RANDOM IDEAS

Floor tiles that have a maximum weight capacity, so you can break them and fall through.

You should be able to pick up any entity, given that you have enough strength.
	i.e., you can shove an enemy in your bag
Chunks as containers? Then creatures could walk around inside you...
And you could have characters controlled by little creatures inside them LOL










%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The player's sight is generated by flood-fill
Tiles drawn relative to the player
Tiles have neighbors
The flood fill moves through each tile's neighbors
This way, connections exists consistently in-world
Ideally, this would be a v2 for a crazy non-euclidean game
Where everything was done through tile neighbors
You could have tardis buildings

This is not a compatible idea with procedural generation, perhaps...
An in-engine level editor mode would be DOPE (PositionGhost?)
Then it would just be ZZT at that point

BUT 

Able to say "these two chunks are up against each other in this way"
And then when the player is in one of the chunks, 
	the neighboring chunk is loaded and displayed seamlessly
I think I can do this
Have tiles that are basically 
IN LOS ALGORITHM:
	if tile.portal then for remaining blocks in line, act as if it's a different chunk
would that be enough?
