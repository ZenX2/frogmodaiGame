How do we include animations that pause game time?
How do we process without advancing game time?

***TODO:***
-Window view into level that centers (lazily/near boundary) on player
-UI that is proportional to the terminalSize
-Chunk transitions (un/loading)
-Save ticks since player lasted visited a chunk
-Fog of War (unseen areas) with FOV

When it's an entity's turn, that's not a little part of the set of processes
It's a multi-loop state
Only monsters in the player's FOV should be visible


Entities create lists of actions using energy points
All action attempts use energy points regardless of success
These lists are passed to systems through the VirtualControllers
Systems skim and remove relevant types of commands
	Systems take all of each type from the queue
If an earlier system takes a type, it will not be left for a later system (likely won't be an issue, no ambiguous commands)

Under the above system, the moving system should process all moves of a given character at the same time
After all, they selected their moves within their turn, they execute within their turn
Or not, because it processes V system V entity, not V entity V systems (where V is "for all")
That means in a given turn,
In order, all entities do all moves
In order, all entities do all attacks
Or should only one action per system be done per entity per tick?

Per entity, actions are processed strictly in order, processing at most one Command per main loop.

In ADOM I can move up to be adjacent to a kobold, and it can attack me in the same time-skip.
This could only happen if the attack was issued after my move happened.
Also, usually you don't see monsters teleporting around at lightning speed.
I infer from this that movement should take up a majority of your energy points.

I should not be skipping spots aka doing two moves from one key press just because i had enough energy

Creatures can end up doing 6 actions in a row without interruption
And it's okay if all those commands take a whole frame to process...

[Side note: you could make this a party-based roguelike, somewhere between dwarf fortress, oregon trail/DRTC, and an RTS
Except it's just like a roguelike but where the UI switches when you switch between your characters
Then you could base the characters more in AI and have them follow the players commands loosely
But that can wait for later]
